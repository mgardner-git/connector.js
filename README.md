connector.js
============

A graph is a set of nodes, each of which can be connected to any other.  This jQuery plugin represents a directed graph of DOM nodes.  By creating a connector on a parent element, it allows all the children elements to become draggable and connectable.  Click and drag to move a node. Click on one node, then click on another to draw a connection between them. The connecting lines will move with the elements.
